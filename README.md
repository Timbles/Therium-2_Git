# THERIUM-2 Github
## Work in Progress by Timbles

If you're here you were probably sent a link or you just really felt like guessing until it worked.
Either way, this is a closed beta (unless I decide to open it to the public), so if you don't want spoilers, I'd advise you don't check this stuff out.
If you do want to test out the current version of Therium-2, then download this and load therium2-test.xml
The best way you can currently help me develop Therium-2 is give feedback, bug reports and suggestions.
