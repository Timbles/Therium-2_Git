Unless you're totally cool with **SPOILERS**.\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm not sure how many of the levels are finished but there's gonna be a lot when I'm done.\r\n\r\n## How to test\r\n\r\nWhen you load and install Therium-2 on your Overgrowth client, load _therium2-test.xml_\r\nReport any bugs and errors that happen from doing that.\r\nWhen you're ready to test the game, load the prologue by typing _therium2-prologue.xml_ and load the beginning by typing _therium2.xml_","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
