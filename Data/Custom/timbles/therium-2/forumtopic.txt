Hi guys and gals, I made a new level campaign for Overgrowth.
There are 32 levels and 6 (8?) different endings. Every level has two or more different gateways to more levels, as in you can go to different levels from one level.
There's a real storyline, backstory and lore that's only explained if you take your time and search for easter eggs, secret levels and notes around the Therium. Two (or four??) of the endings are secret (you have to go through secret levels to get them!)

Begin the campaign by typing therium2.xml
You can also go through a tutorial by typing therium2-tutorial.xml

[spoiler=Important Gameplay Info]Before you load therium2.xml, try playing through the prologue! therium2-prologue.xml
THERE IS A TUTORIAL LEVEL! therium2-tutorial.xml
Baked Shadows will cause most levels to run slowly and have terrible framerate, so keep Baked Shadows to off for Dynamic Shadows instead. Baked Shadows is especially framerate hungry on indoors levels, so either keep baked shadows not calcualated on those levels or just have dynamic shadows.
If you're having trouble running some of the maps, try restarting your computer (and I mean holding the power button on your case down to force it to shut down). It definitely helps if you leave your computer on overnight.
You can also disable Post Effects or Gamma Correction in the settings to increase performance. Most levels look bad with Gamma Correction off, though.[/spoiler]

[spoiler=Requirements]- Ruined Arches
- Watchtower
- Sky Temple
- Steelraven 7's Hotspot pack
- River Fight
- Landmark Lantern[/spoiler]

[spoiler=Inspirations]- The Tower series by Elegaro
- Jade: Diamask Pass (quite a while back)
- Viking Biomes by iDubbbz (it first gave me the idea of non-linearity)
- Last of Us (you'll definitely see it on the D path)
- Mysterious Mountain by Elegaro
- Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee (when you first arrive in the F path levels, I wanted to replicate the feeling that you get when you first enter the wilderness part of Oddworld).
- A serious lack of storytelling and narrative in Overgrowth maps
- To inspire you guys![/spoiler]

-------------------------------------

After being framed, you find yourself imprisoned in some place you barely recognize. Most of it is in disrepair, and a lot of people are going around, setting things up.
Thankfully, you give them the slip and manage to escape your cell. Someone named Jared aids you and you go through the Therium, which seems to be a huge expanse of ruins being taken over by the Cinderbreathe Empire.

PM me if you have any questions and stuff.
I really hope you guys take the time to find and figure out the backstory, I put a lot of thought into it.
Please report bugs, PM me feedback (I'll fix anything that's really gamebreaking in any way).
Serious props to Thomason for making some dialogue scripts.
And honestly, if it weren't for Mr. Gay Retard's (iDubbbz) level, Viking Biomes, I wouldn't have even made this. Seriously, that was the first time I've seen something that non-linear in Overgrowth and it really inspired me to make something even bigger. Which is odd, of course but whatever.
